# Code Your Future React API

Returns HTTP responses for usage in the [CYF React module project](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/React-Module-Project).

## Development

The API is implemented as [Netlify functions](https://docs.netlify.com/functions/overview/).
For local integration testing, you can install the [Netlify CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/) and use `netlify dev`.
